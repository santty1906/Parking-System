# Parking System

This project consists of a simple parking lot management system that allows vehicle entry and exit registration, as well as showing the current occupancy status of parking spaces.

The project includes two implementations:

- A **C version**, developed as a university assignment.
- A **Python version**, created for personal practice and learning purposes.

## 📌 Project Versions

### ✅ C Version

- Manages five parking spots (A to E).
- Allows registering vehicle entries by license plate.
- Allows registering vehicle exits by license plate.
- Displays the current status of each parking spot.
- Console menu-driven interface.

### 🐍 Python Version

- Uses a class-based design with a dictionary for parking spots.
- Contains predefined data for vehicle license plates to demonstrate functionality.
- Console output simulates user interaction with parking registration and status display.
